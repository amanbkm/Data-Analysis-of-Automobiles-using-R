# Data-Analysis-of-Automobiles-using-R
Program requirements & dataset briefing :

The dataset explores the carsâ€™ fuel consumption, co2 emissions and tax bands on the data provided by the vehicle certification agency (vca).  The data shows the cars that were first registered from 1 March 2001 onwards.   The dataset provided is related to the car fuel consumption and co2 emission from years 2000 to 2013.

Tasks :
-	Perform several analyses on the given dataset using appropriate techniques and concepts to retrieve necessary information to help with decision making.   
-	The analysis should be in deep & detailed.
-	4-6 Questions through analysis and 2-3 sub-questions for every question.
-	Import the given dataset into your programming environment
-	Examine the imported data and formulate a set of questions to study the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from registered cars.
-	Clean, process & transform the dataset into a specific format.
-	Apply a mixture of data exploration, manipulation and visualization techniques in the analysis.  
-	Explain and justify the techniques that have been chosen
-	Reports your findings by interpreting the results obtained from the analysis.  
-	The R program should compile and be executed without errors.
-	Validation should be done for each entry from the users to avoid logical errors. 
-	No duplication is allowed in dataset.
-	Include :
-	Comments on programming code, variable naming conventions and indentation 
-	The analysis should be meaningful and effective in providing the information for the decision making.
-	Any additional features implemented must improve the retrieval effects.
